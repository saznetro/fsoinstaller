The Forked project:
I'm playing with an old project for fun. 
- Convert it to a maven project
- Update it with unit /function test
- Continous test feature

To create the FreeSpaceOpenInstaller.jar please run:

mvn install 

and find it under ${project}/target

To run unit test from console:

mvn test

To run unit test from eclipse:
Right click on the test classes that you want to run and Run as > TestNG test

Thanks for the original project!
